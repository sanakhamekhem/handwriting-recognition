Handwriting recognition
There can be an easier version of this and a more difficult one.
Easy: design a system based on HMMs to recognize a finite vocabulary of hand written words were the input is printed by the user. Letters are assumed to be seperate.
Hard: same as the easy project but input is not printed (i.e. your own handwriting).
For either version of this project, assume a vocabulary of 20 words. For training and input, you might want to use graph paper.
